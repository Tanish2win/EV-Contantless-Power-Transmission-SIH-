Contactless power transmission in EVs uses **inductive coupling**, where a primary coil on the ground generates a magnetic field that induces current in a secondary coil under the car. This AC is converted to DC to charge the battery. It’s like a wireless charger for EVs—safe, convenient, and efficient over short distances.
